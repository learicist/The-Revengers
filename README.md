NOTES ON PUSHING CHANGES
1. Do a git pull in the master branch.

2. Before you start working, be sure to switch to your own branch in the terminal. This will prevent issues down the road when trying to push your changes.

3. Push your changes to your own branch, create a pull request in github, and send a notification for it to be merged by another user.
